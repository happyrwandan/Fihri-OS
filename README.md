## System requirements (measured)

Measured on the reference machine (i5-8250U, 12 GB RAM, Intel UHD 620, 1920×1080) — full data in the [release report](docs/FIHRI-OS-1.0-REPORT.md#1-system-requirements-measured-on-this-machine).

| Resource | Minimum | Preferred |
|---|---|---|
| **RAM** | 4 GB (installer blocks below) | 8 GB (DDE core ≈ 0.9–1.1 GB; browser session ≈ 2.1 GB) |
| **Storage** | 32 GB (installer blocks below) | 64 GB SSD (installed tree is 13.5 GB + updates/snapshots) |
| **CPU** | 64-bit x86-64, dual-core | 4+ cores (whole desktop+apps measured at ~3% of a 4C/8T i5) |
| **GPU** | Any Mesa-supported Intel/AMD GPU; llvmpipe software fallback works | Intel/AMD hardware GL (NVIDIA proprietary optional, consent-based offer) |
| **Display** | 1366×768 | 1920×1080 (validated; multi-monitor supported) |
| **Install media** | 8 GB USB | — |
| **Network** | Optional at install | Broadband for updates and remote-work use |

## Install

1. Download `fihri-os-1.0-amd64.iso` from [Releases](../../releases) and verify the published SHA-256.
2. Write it to a USB stick (≥ 8 GB) with [balenaEtcher](https://etcher.balena.io/), [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/) (DD mode) or `dd if=fihri-os-1.0-amd64.iso of=/dev/sdX bs=4M status=progress oflag=sync`.
3. Boot from the USB (the live session is a full Fihri OS desktop — take it for a spin).
4. Launch **Install Fihri OS** (Calamares): erase disk, replace a previous OS, install **alongside Windows**, or manual partitioning. Swap defaults to RAM size (hibernate-capable) and is user-adjustable, including none.
5. Reboot into Fihri OS. Everything in the screenshots above is preinstalled — no account, no activation, no telemetry opt-outs to hunt for.

Notes: the installer requires ≥ 4 GB RAM and ≥ 32 GB storage. On NVIDIA hardware, first graphical boot shows a one-time **consent dialog** for the tested proprietary driver — declining is remembered and nothing installs silently.

## Fihri OS 1.0 vs Windows 11

| | Windows 11 | Fihri OS 1.0 |
|---|---|---|
| **Price** | Paid license ($139 Home / $199 Pro per device) | **Free** — download, install, and share |
| **Remote Desktop (host)** | Pro/Enterprise only — Home cannot host RDP | **Full-session RDP server on every install** — H.264, clipboard, session handoff, works with the Windows 11 24H2 client |
| **Office suite** | Microsoft 365 subscription | **ElixirOffice + CryptPad included** — DOCX/XLSX/PPTX/ODF editing locally; encrypted, self-hosted collaborative pads; no cloud account required |
| **Updates** | Forced reboots on Microsoft's schedule | **User-controlled, selectable updates** with a details pane and a **Driver Updates** section |
| **Active Directory** | AD + Entra ID join | **AD join with auto-detection and a guided wizard** (no Entra ID/MDM yet — see limitations) |
| **Telemetry** | Extensive, mandatory diagnostics | **None** — local-first by design; feedback is consent-gated and secret-redacted |
| **Disk encryption** | BitLocker everywhere | **Not yet** (top honest gap — see limitations) |
| **Security / AV** | Defender (ML/reputation/SmartScreen) | **UFW on by default, ClamAV on-access, no telemetry** — signature-based, not ML-backed |
| **Customization** | Limited | **Full theme engine** — light/dark, 8 themes + custom, accent colors, translucent dock |
| **Languages out of the box** | Language packs downloaded during/after install | **7 locales fully staged in the image** — English, French, Spanish, German, Arabic, Chinese (Simplified & Traditional) with complete font coverage including Arabic shaping and CJK |
| **Backup** | Restore points + File History | **Timeshift snapshots + Déjà Dup file backup** |
| **Online account** | Pushes a Microsoft account | **None required** — a local account is all you need |
| **Ads & sponsored apps** | Start-menu suggestions, promoted apps | **None** — no ads, no sponsored apps, ever |
| **Crash reporting** | Sent to Microsoft | **None** — diagnostics never leave the machine |
| **Open source** | Closed source | **GPLv3** — every line is open and auditable |
| **AI assistant** | Copilot | None (deliberate scope) |

The full area-by-area comparison with verdicts (including where Windows 11 still wins) is in the [release report](docs/FIHRI-OS-1.0-REPORT.md#2-feature-comparison--fihri-os-10-vs-windows-11).

## 🎨 Beautiful by default

- Deepin Desktop Environment with a translucent fashion-mode dock and rounded corners
- **Full theme engine**: 8 shipped themes (bloom, flow, hazy-color, macaron, nirvana, organic-glass, square, vintage), each with light & dark variants, plus a custom theme — light/dark flips apply live and write through to every app, with dock/tray contrast bridges that keep popups readable in both modes
- Launcher with adaptive icons that stay crisp at every display scale, and Windows-style search that works
- **Quick Actions slide-in panel**: notification center plus weather, calendar, memory and world-clock widgets
- **Filled, consistent icon set** across dock, launcher, file manager, system dialogs and the login screen
- A curated fresh-user wallpaper (plus a full picker), and a deduplicated desktop right-click menu with a working "Set Wallpaper" action
- Settings search that understands synonyms (mouse / trackpad / pointer…)
- Smooth, pixel-precise trackpad scrolling (macOS-like) out of the box
- Display scaling that applies without logging out
- DisplayLink support included — USB docks and DisplayLink monitors work out of the box

## 🔒 Office that respects your privacy

- **ElixirOffice** — native editors for DOCX/XLSX/PPTX/ODF/RTF/CSV
- **CryptPad** — self-hosted, end-to-end-encrypted collaboration: documents, spreadsheets, slides, forms and more
- Familiar **ribbon-style toolbars** in both suites
- CryptPad runs on-demand and loopback-only (binds to 127.0.0.1; 0 MB while idle)
- Works fully offline; cloud sync greys itself out when you're offline instead of failing
- Opens `.docx`, `.xlsx`, `.pptx`, and `.odt` files by default

## 🔄 Windows-style updates, under your control

- Sectioned, selectable update list with a details pane — see exactly what each update does
- Security updates grouped for quick review
- **Application Updates section** — CryptPad and ElixirOffice updates arrive in the same window as system updates
- **Driver Updates section** — hardware scan with recommended/open/proprietary flags (ubuntu-drivers engine), one click to switch GPU, Wi-Fi and DisplayLink drivers; NVIDIA hardware gets a consent-gated offer (nothing installs silently)
- **Steam one-click install** from the same window (multiverse and 32-bit libraries set up automatically)
- Clear reboot banner instead of surprise restarts
- Ubuntu 24.04 LTS base: security updates to 2029 (ESM to 2032), plus fwupd firmware updates

## 🏢 Enterprise-ready

- Active Directory auto-detection when the network cable is plugged in
- Guided domain join wizard built on realmd/sssd, with a domain field in the installer handed to first-boot join
- Polkit-secured operations, including a GUI leave flow
- No plaintext credentials anywhere in the join pipeline — covered by an automated test suite (71 tests)

## 🖥️ Remote work, both directions

- **RDP server on every install** — walk up or remote in; NLA + TLS, H.264 (AVC420), bidirectional clipboard, resize-aware cursors, session handoff with lock
- **Remote Work wizard** for connecting out: Citrix Workspace (preinstalled with the open H.264 plugin, USB, audio/mic/webcam and Teams media config), VMware Horizon (guided setup), and native Windows RDP (FreeRDP with host/user/domain/password, own window)
- Privacy-gated RDP: the physical screen blanks while you're remoted in, and the session locks when you disconnect
- Stale-connection guard: a dropped client never locks you out of your own machine
- Left-handed friendly — a mouse button-swap toggle applies to both local and remote sessions
- Keyboard layout and CapsLock/NumLock stay in sync between the remote client and the machine

## 🛡️ Security & privacy

- **No telemetry, no crash uploads, no ads, no forced online account** — vendor crash reporting (apport/whoopsie) is disabled
- **UFW firewall enabled by default** — default-deny incoming
- **ClamAV + clamonacc on-access scanning** with fresh definitions at build
- **Linux permission model by design** — polkit privilege separation, no everyday admin rights
- **Consent-based driver installs** — nothing installs silently (NVIDIA offer, updates, everything)
- Local-first **Fihri Feedback** app with 11-pattern secret redaction and zero network calls — you submit the bundle yourself
- System services listen on loopback only — CryptPad binds to `127.0.0.1`
- **systemd-hardened local services** — ProtectSystem=strict, NoNewPrivileges, PrivateTmp
- **Timeshift system snapshots** for fast, easy recovery

## 📦 Curated apps, ready to go

- **Brave** browser (default) and **Chromium** available
- **Thunderbird** mail (with built-in calendar) and dde-calendar
- **ElixirOffice** and **CryptPad** as the integrated office stack
- **VLC** media player plus the Deepin suite: Files, Terminal, Text Editor, Calendar, Music, Movie, Album, Draw, Reader, Screen Recorder, Calculator, System Monitor
- **Timeshift** backups and **GParted** partition editor
- CUPS printing, Bluetooth, Orca screen reader, on-screen keyboard
- **7 locales fully staged** — en, fr, es, de, ar, zh-Hans, zh-Hant — with the fonts to match (Noto CJK, Arabic shaping)
- 2,920 packages preinstalled; thousands more via apt / dde-store (Flathub installable post-install if you want it)

## 🐛 Honest limitations (what's not in 1.0)

We'd rather tell you up front:

1. **No full-disk encryption yet** — the installer does not offer a BitLocker/LUKS-class encrypted-install path. This is the top gap and a 1.1 candidate.
2. **No native Microsoft Office** — ElixirOffice and CryptPad cover the formats and collaboration well, but they are not MS Office; power-MS-Office users will notice.
3. **ClamAV is signature-based** — no Defender-grade ML/reputation engine or browse-time SmartScreen.
4. **No Entra ID join / MDM (Intune)** — classic AD join is included; cloud identity management is not.
5. **No Windows-Hello biometrics, no Copilot, no Snap-layouts tiling, no Xbox/Game Bar, no WSL.**
6. **Driver breadth relies on the kernel** plus explicit NVIDIA/firmware paths — no automatic vendor-driver back-catalog.
7. **Flathub/Flatpak not preinstalled** (installable post-install), and fewer consumer-brand store apps than Windows.
